title: TownSuite Documentation Repo
publish: false
---

This repository contains sample files for generating a documentation site.

The site uses Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator.   It uses plugins and is thus not compatible with github pages. For hosting it yourself, see [Setting up a local copy of the website](#setting-up-a-local-copy-of-the-website).

Contributing to the website
---------------------------

**Note:** Major issues or feature requests should be filed on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TownSuite/Documentation) first, so we can discuss the implications.

If you want to edit a page, the easiest way is to click the __Edit page on GitHub__ link under the page title on the website.

This will open the source file on GitHub where you can click the __pencil button__ to start editing.

GitHub's editor shows you both the __Markdown__ source as well as a preview of the rendered page.
