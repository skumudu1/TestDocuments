 <li>`_includes` - *special folder* contains snippets that can be included in other pages </li>
 <li>`_layouts` - *special folder* contains the layouts that are shared between pages. Layouts can be inherited, the root layout is `index.html`.</li>
 <li>`_site` - the output of the generated site is stored here by default, this folder only exists after Jekyll built the site</li>
 <li>`_assets` - contains the main stylesheet and javascript</li>

Any other folders are most likely user created content
